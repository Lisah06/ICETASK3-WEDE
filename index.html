    <h4> This movie is my favourite movie because it served as an epic conclusion to over a decade of Marvel storytelling, delivering both spectacle and emotional depth. It tied together character arcs with moments of sacrifice, growth, and closure while balancing action, humor, and heart. Iconic scenes, nostalgic callbacks, and surprising twists gave me the payoff I had been anticipating for years, making it feel more like a cultural event than just a movie. Its themes of teamwork, loss, and hope resonated deeply, leaving me entertained, moved, and satisfied.</h4>
